As it often goes with bartenders, however, it has been riffed on and experimented with over the years\u2014especially during the rise of Tiki bars and tropical drink culture.Our&nbsp;Hurricane recipe&nbsp;below features&nbsp;light rum,&nbsp;dark rum,&nbsp;lime juice, orange juice, passion fruit juice,&nbsp;simple syrup, and&nbsp;grenadine, with an&nbsp;orange slice&nbsp;or wedge for the&nbsp;garnish. Sometimes, a&nbsp;maraschino cherry&nbsp;or a lime is used as an alternative&nbsp;garnish.Who invented the&nbsp;Hurricane Cocktail?While the origin isn't certain, the&nbsp;Hurricane Cocktail&nbsp;is widely believed to have been invented in the&nbsp;1940s&nbsp;in post-war&nbsp;New Orleans. It's usually credited to bar owner&nbsp;Pat O'Brien.The Hurricane was always intended to be a&nbsp;rum cocktail, as after&nbsp;World War&nbsp;II many spirits including&nbsp;whiskey,&nbsp;gin, and brandy were in short supply but rum was plentiful.&nbsp;O'Brien&nbsp;reportedly came up with the&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;when he wanted to get rid of a surplus of&nbsp;rum&nbsp;he had lying around his namesake bar, Pat O'Briens.He ended up serving the drink in a&nbsp;hurricane lamp-shaped glass as a marketing ploy (this glass is known today as the eponymous&nbsp;Hurricane glass) and it has been a tropical favorite ever since.If you have a large group of people to serve, you can easily turn the Hurricane into a punch\u2014simply multiply the&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;below by the number of servings you need.How to make a&nbsp;Hurricane Cocktail?Making a Hurricane is not hard, but it does require you have a&nbsp;cocktail shaker and plenty of ice. Start by shaking all&nbsp;ingredients&nbsp;except the&nbsp;garnish&nbsp;together with ice.

James Beard, the well-known American culinary icon, considered the Old-Fashioned one of the best of cocktails.Classic Old-Fashioned Cocktail RecipeCocktail aficionados have long argued about the \"proper\" recipe for an Old-Fashioned. Sugar cube or simple syrup? Orange twist or muddled fruit? A large cube of ice or something else? At Bevvy, our preferred Old-Fashioned calls for the simpler formula of the \"classic recipe\"\u2014consisting of whiskey, sugar, and bitters over a large cubed ice\u2014there'll be no muddled fruit or bright cherries. That being said, the recipe below is very close to what people would have been drinking back when it was first invented in the 1800s.This Old-Fashioned recipes call for building your drink in the glass, but an alternate method involves stirring the ingredients with ice in a mixing glass before straining them into the serving glass.Who invented the Old-Fashioned cocktail?Among those that have laid claim to inventing the Old-Fashioned, the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky may be the best known and has been credited to have created the drink\u2014but this claim has been debunked. Many other attempted claims have also been debunked, some due to strange recipes, others to date and timeline inconsistencies.The first known recipe for the Old-Fashioned is from a Chicago bartender named Theodore Proulx, in his book The Bartender's Manual, but even still a connection has never been made that Chicago was the Old-Fashioned's birthplace, nor Proulx the creator.So who did invent the Old-Fashioned? We may never know for sure. As Robert Simonson said in his book The Old-Fashioned: The Story of the World's First Classic Cocktail, with Recipes and Lore: \"[The history of] the Old-Fashioned is a much more complicated case. Being an outgrowth of the Whiskey Cocktail, it evolved more than it arrived.
